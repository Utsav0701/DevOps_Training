# Project Overview

#### In this capstone project, you will create a comprehensive automated deployment pipeline for a web application on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu using Ansible. You will follow best practices for playbooks and roles, implement version control, document and maintain your code, break down tasks into roles, write reusable and maintainable code, and use dynamic inventory scripts. This project will culminate in a fully functional deployment, demonstrating your mastery of Ansible for infrastructure automation.
